# Mountain Mayhem prototype

This directory is intentionally isolated from the UNC Futbol League website. It has no public route, arcade card, leaderboard integration, or production documentation entry.

## Run locally

```powershell
cd mountain-app
node server.mjs
```

Open `http://localhost:4174`.

## Test

```powershell
cd mountain-app
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

Phaser 3.90 is pinned in `vendor/` so this prototype has no install step or runtime network dependency.
